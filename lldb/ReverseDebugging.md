Reverse Debugging
=================

**[ This project has been created in the context of my master's thesis and absolutely no guarantee is provided regarding stability, feature-completeness and future development, since it will most probably depend solely on my personal free time and future interests. ]**

This is an early-stage proof of concept for live reverse debugging in LLDB, similar to [GDB](https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/ReverseDebug), that currently provides initial support for C and C++ on the latest macOS (Darwin on x86-64).

The current implementation takes advantage of existing functionality in LLDB, that forces the target to always be executed in single-step mode. Single-step execution imposes a 1000x or greater slowdown, but proved to be a nice enough starting point for the scope of this project.

As the implementation matures, steps are gradually being taken to alleviate the slowdown (see [Avoiding Unwanted Symbols](#avoiding-unwanted-symbols) and [Evaluating User Expressions](#evaluating-user-expressions) below), although the current levels of slowdown and memory overhead remain far from ideal for daily use or use with non-trivial programs.

However, there is still lots of room for improvement and I will continue to look for new ways to speed up tracing after completing some of the functionality described in [Future Work](#future-work).

# How to Use

Follow the [official instructions](https://lldb.llvm.org/resources/build.html) to build LLDB as usual. No special flags or build steps are required.


# Internals

### Capturing Snapshots

A snapshot of the thread's state and environment (registers, variables, heap) is captured right before each instruction is executed.

- **Stack Frames**

    The LLDB data structures describing all active stack frames are deep-copied along with related metadata, such as the index of the currently selected stack frame and the set of register and variable information per stack frame.

- **Registers & Variables**

    The values of all registers and variables for all active stack frames are currently being backed up, regardless of whether the instruction about to be executed would modify any of those, with the exception of exception state registers, which are always ignored.

    In addition, the modified registers and variables are marked, enabling the user to list modifications with the `thread tracing modification list` command.

- **Heap Modifications**

    If the instruction about to be executed is recognized as one that may store, based on the information provided by the Disassembler plugin, then the destination operand is translated into a (virtual) memory address and the instruction mnemonic is used to extract the number of bytes about to be stored.

    Given that this address corresponds to the heap (that is, does not belong to the stack and does not correspond to any known symbol or code), the contents of that memory location are saved right before and after the aforementioned instruction is executed, in order to backup both the old and the new contents of that location and enable the debugger to undo or redo the write.

    Additionally, just like with registers and variables, modified heap regions are marked, thus allowing listing of modifications via the `thread tracing modification list` command.

- **Thread State**

    Besides the stack frames and associated data, information about the thread state is also captured. In particular, the current stop reason, since it is modified when the user steps backwards, replays one or more recorded instructions or a user expression is evaluated and thus needs to be restored when execution continues normally, and the list of completed thread plans, so that they won't be executed again when the thread resumes.

- **Source Location**

    The original source line is also saved for each instruction in order to enable stepping backwards or replaying one or more statements (source lines).


### Restoring Snapshots

When stepping backwards or replaying for one or more instrucitons, the state and the environment of the thread are restored from the snapshot captured at the point in time, right before the destination instruction was executed.

- **Stack Frames**

    The data stuctures describing all active stack frames and related metadata are restored from the snapshot.

- **Registers & Variables**

    When the user steps backwards or replays, the debugger restores only the register and variable values of the deepest (zeroth) stack frame. However, when another stack frame is selected via the `frame select <frame_index>` command, then the register and variable values of the newly selected stack frame are restored.

- **Heap Modifications**

    Stepping backwards or forward within the recorded execution history means that the state of the heap must also be restored. This is accomplished by undoing or reapplying the modifications made by each store instruction sequentially, up to the point in time where the thread is restored.

    If a heap region has since been unmapped, then the restoration of the old contents fails and the user is warned that all history assosciated with that particular heap region will be discarded, since it is no longer needed.

    On the other side, if the heap region in question is still mapped and thus writable, but its contents have been invalidated or moved, e.g. through a call to `free()` or `realloc()`, respectively, then that particular heap region ends up in an undefined state, of which the user remains unaware.

    Setting `target.process.thread.tracing-jump-over-deallocation-functions` will cause the debugger to not execute traced calls to known deallocation functions, such as `free()` and `munmap()`, increasing the number of heap regions that will ultimately be available, since the regions won't be invalidated and reclaimed or unmapped. That is achieved by detecting calls to such functions and replacing the opcode of the `call` instruction with a `nop` until the thread moves on to the next instruction and the opcode of the `call` instruction is restored. This operation is mostly transparent to the user, since the `nop` instruction is only visible in the disassembly while the thread is stopped at the `call` instruction that has been replaced.

    Identifying reallocated pages could be possible via a custom allocator or special tracking of reallocation functions, but resolving this issue was out of the scope of this project and thus a solution was not considered.

- **Thread State**

    Finally, the stop reason and the list of completed thread plans at that point in time are also restored from the snapshot.


### Avoiding Unwanted Symbols

As already discussed, executing the target in single-step mode is extremely slow and imposes a great memory overhead, thus, in order to speed up execution and minimize memory footprint, all symbols that belong either to libraries under `/usr/lib/` or to the `std` C++ namespace are always executed normally and not traced.

Furthermore, the user may define a set of additional functions to ignore via the following settings:
- `target.process.thread.tracing-avoid-symbols-regex`
- `target.process.thread.tracing-avoid-libraries`

In order to avoid a symbol, single-stepping and tracing are suspended before the relevant call instruction is executed and an artificial breakpoint that is deleted on first hit is set at the instruction right after the call. When the call finishes and the breakpoint is reached, then the callback of the breakpoint, which resumes single-stepping and tracing, is executed and the breakpoint is automatically deleted, allowing the thread to continue running.


### Evaluating User Expressions

As for symbols that are ignored, tracing and single-stepping are suspended before a user expression is evaluated and resumed write after the evaluation finishes.

In contrast to the avoided symbols, however, the state of the deepest (zeroth) stack frame, along with its assosciated registers and variables, is also restored after the evaluation finishes, in order to undo any modifications during the evaluation.


### Respecting Breakpoints

When continuing backwards, the thread steps back until either beginning of recorded history is reached or an enabled breakpoint is hit.

Respectively, when replaying forward, the thread replays recorded instructions until either end of recorded history is reached or an enabled breakpoint is hit.


### Bookmarks

The user is also able to mark points of interest within the recorded history and optionally provide a name for them, in order to be able to jump easier from one point in time to another.


### Caching

Results of frequent and expensive computations are cached, aiming to improve tracing performance and consequently reduce the slowdown that is imposed on the target.

For now, this translates to caching whether an address corrseponds to the heap or the stack and whether a symbol belongs to a library installed under `/usr/lib/`.


# Code Details

Currently, most of the implementation is provided by the `ThreadPlanInstructionTracer` class in [ThreadPlanTracer.h](https://github.com/vangelists/llvm-project/blob/public/reverse-debugging/lldb/include/lldb/Target/ThreadPlanTracer.h) and [ThreadPlanTracer.cpp](https://github.com/vangelists/llvm-project/blob/public/reverse-debugging/lldb/source/Target/ThreadPlanTracer.cpp).

The user-facing commands are implemented in [CommandObjectThread.cpp](https://github.com/vangelists/llvm-project/blob/public/reverse-debugging/lldb/source/Commands/CommandObjectThread.cpp).

A number of other files have also been modified, albeit to a lesser extent. You may see all the changes by [comparing the `public/reverse-debugging` branch to `master`](https://github.com/vangelists/llvm-project/compare/master...vangelists:public/reverse-debugging).


# Future Work

In no particular order:

- [ ] Track modifications made by system calls and other known functions, e.g. `memcpy()`.
- [ ] Add ability to jump directly to the previous or next point where a value was modified.
- [ ] Handle reallocated heap regions.
- [ ] Add support for watchpoints.
- [ ] Create automated tests.
- [ ] Minimize memory footprint, i.e. back up only what is necessary.
- [ ] Expand functionality to multi-threaded programs.
- [ ] Export reverse debugging API at the SB level.
- [ ] Consider moving the core functionality into a plugin that would work via the API.
- [ ] Use the public API to provide a GUI, e.g. for Visual Studio Code.
- [ ] Add support for additional platforms, e.g. Darwin on AArch64.
- [ ] Add support for more languages, e.g. Swift or Rust.
